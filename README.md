## Art Space

Art Space is the test project of the second unit of the *Android Basics with Compose* learning path, provided by Android Developers. It is focused on handling simple user interactions, always with the help of Jetpack Compose.

The project demonstrates the ability to understand layout recomposition and state in Android applications, available at the following link

* [Layout Composition Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle#:~:text=Recomposition%20is%20when%20Jetpack%20Compose,composition%20and%20updated%20by%20recomposition.)
* [State](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state)

The project consists of just one screen whose layout is developed through Jetpack Compose. User interaction is handled via layout recomposition.
